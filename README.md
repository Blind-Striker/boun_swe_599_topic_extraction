# SWE 599 - Topic Extraction using Knowledge Graphs (Wikidata, DBPedia)
This project aims to extract meaningful topics from short, messy text sources (such as tweets, Reddit posts, and Instagram captions) by leveraging the structured data available in knowledge graphs like Wikidata and DBPedia.

## Problem Statement
The main challenge of this project is to identify and extract relevant topics from unstructured short texts and connect them with semantically organized knowledge available in knowledge graphs. This will help improve various applications, including information retrieval, content recommendation, and text classification.

## Objectives
- Investigate Named Entity Linking (NEL) techniques, such as TagMe and other ML-based approaches, to detect entities from short texts.
- Research topic modeling techniques to extract topics from the given texts.
- Design and implement a solution that connects extracted topics and entities with the structured information from knowledge graphs like Wikidata and DBPedia.
